# BikesSharing_M-L_Assignment

In this assignment I have created a Linear model that explains the demand for shared bikes with respect to available independent variables.
Purpose of this model is to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
Accordingly the bike sharing company can manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
